No release notes were kept for this version.

## Changes in version 0.6.0
Mwclient 0.6.0 was released in February 2008.
This was the first official release via Sourceforge.
This version removed some Pywikipedia influences added in 0.4.

## Changes in versions 0.5
Mwclient 0.5 was an architectural redesign
which accomplished easy extendability
and added proper support for continuations. 

## Changes in version 0.4
Mwclient 0.4 was somewhat the basis for future releases
and shows the current module architecture.
It was influenced by Pywikipedia,
which was discovered by the author at the time.

## Changes in versions 0.2 and 0.3
Mwclient 0.2 and 0.3 were probably a bit of a generalization,
and maybe already used the API for some part,
but details are unknown.

## Mwclient 0.1
Mwclient 0.1 was a non-API module for accessing Wikipedia using an XML parser.
