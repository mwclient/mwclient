# Release Notes for mwclient

## Changes in version 0.8.2

This is the development version of mwclient.

## Changes in version 0.8.1

Mwclient 0.8.1 was released on 5 February 2016.

* [2016-01-23] [@Danmichaelo](https://github.com/Danmichaelo):
  Add more options to `Site.parse`.
* [2016-02-05] [@tosher](https://github.com/tosher), [@AdamWill](https://github.com/AdamWill):
  Fix GeneratorList with Python 3.
  [#106](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/106).

## Changes in version 0.8.0

Mwclient 0.8.0 was released on 10 January 2016.

Upgrade notices / breaking changes:

 - Saving a section rather than the full page can now only
   be achieved by passing in the section parameter explicitly to the `save`
   method. The section number is no longer part of the `Page` state, so
   `Page.save()` no longer makes use of a section parameter earlier passed
   into `Page.text()`. A deprecation warning was added in 0.7.2.
 - Https is now used as default.

## Changes in version 0.7.0

Mwclient 0.7.0 was released on 27 September 2014.

Upgrade notices:
 - This version requires minimum Python 2.6 and MediaWiki 1.16.
   Support for Python 2.4–2.5 and MediaWiki 1.11–1.15 has been dropped.
 - The `Page.edit()` method has been renamed to `Page.text()`.
   While `Page.edit()` is deprecated, it will be available for a long time.
   The old `Page.text` attribute, that used to store a copy of the wikitext
   from the last `Page.edit()` call, has been removed entirely.
   The `readonly` argument has also been removed (it was never really
   implemented, so it acted only as a dummy argument before the removal).
 - The `Page.get_expanded()` method has been deprecated in favour of
   calling `Page.text(expandtemplates=True)`.

## Changes in version 0.6.1
Mwclient 0.6.1 was released in May 2008.
No release notes were kept for this version.

## Changes in version 0.6.0
Mwclient 0.6.0 was released in February 2008.
This was the first official release via Sourceforge.
This version removed some Pywikipedia influences added in 0.4.

## Changes in versions 0.5
Mwclient 0.5 was an architectural redesign
which accomplished easy extendability
and added proper support for continuations.

## Changes in version 0.4
Mwclient 0.4 was somewhat the basis for future releases
and shows the current module architecture.
It was influenced by Pywikipedia,
which was discovered by the author at the time.

## Changes in versions 0.2 and 0.3
Mwclient 0.2 and 0.3 were probably a bit of a generalization,
and maybe already used the API for some part,
but details are unknown.

## Mwclient 0.1
Mwclient 0.1 was a non-API module for accessing Wikipedia using an XML parser.
