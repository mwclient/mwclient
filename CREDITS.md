The **mwclient** framework was originally written by Bryan Tong Minh
  ([@btongminh](https://github.com/btongminh))
  and released in 2008 [on Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwclient/).
Bryan maintained the project until version 0.6.5, released on 6 May 2011.

In 2013, Waldir Pimenta ([@waldyrious](https://github.com/waldyrious))
  contacted Bryan and proposed helping out with a conversion from SVN to git
  and moving the project to Github.
After getting the appropriate permissions,
  he performed the repository conversion
  using [sf2github](http://github.com/ttencate/sf2github)
  ([#1](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/1)),
  converted the wiki previously hosted on sourceforge
  ([#12](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/12)),
  updated the sourceforge project page
  ([#15](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/15)),
  identified the users who had created bug reports
  ([#1, comment](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/1#issuecomment-13972022)),
  contacted the authors of forks of the project
  suggesting them to provide their changes as PRs
  ([#14](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/14)),
  and handed the repository to Bryan
  ([#11](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/11)).

Dan Michael O. Heggø ([@danmichaelo](https://github.com/danmichaelo))
  was the author of one of those forks,
  and the most prolific submitter of PRs
  in the early history of mwclient as a git repository.
Not long after the git transition, the repository was moved to an organization
  ([#12, comment](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient/issues/12#issuecomment-20447515)),
  and Dan became the main force behind the 2014 release of version 0.7.0
  (the first after a 3-year hiatus).
Since then, he has been the lead maintainer of the project,
  which has attracted contributions from
  [several other people](../../graphs/contributors).

For more details on the technical history of the project,
  see the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) document.
