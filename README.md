This file describes mwclient-0.6.5.
The latest version is available in the 
[github repository](https://github.com/btongminh/mwclient).

Mwclient is a client to the [MediaWiki API](http://mediawiki.org/wiki/API)
and allows access to almost all implemented API functions.
Mwclient requires Python 2.4.
This version supports MediaWiki 1.11 and above.
However, for functions not available in the current MediaWiki,
a `MediaWikiVersionError` is raised.

This framework is written by Bryan Tong Minh and serves most of his bots.
The framework and this documentation are primarily written for personal use
and may or may not work for you.
In case it doesn't, Bryan can be contacted on btongminh@users.sourceforge.net.

This framework heavily depends on Bob Ippolito's
[simplejson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson).


## Implementation notes ##
Most properties and generators accept the same parameters as the API,
without their two letter prefix.
Exceptions to this rule:
* `Image.imageinfo` is the imageinfo of the latest image. Earlier versions can be
  fetched using `imagehistory()`
* `Site.all*`: parameter `[ap]from` renamed to `start`
* `categorymembers` is implemented as `Category.members`
* `deletedrevs` is `deletedrevisions`
* `usercontribs` is `usercontributions`
* First parameters of `search` and `usercontributions` are `search` and `user` 
  respectively

Properties and generators are implemented as Python generators.
Their limit parameter is only an indication of the number of items in one chunk.
It is not the total limit.
Doing `list(generator(limit = limit))` will return ALL items of generator,
and not be limited by the limit value.
Default chunk size is generally the maximum chunk size.


## HTTPS ##
To use https, specify the host as a tuple in the form of `('https', hostname)`.


## Example ##
```python
## For more information, see REFERENCE.md
# Init site object
import mwclient
site = mwclient.Site('commons.wikimedia.org')
site.login(username, password) # Optional

# Edit page
page = site.Pages['Commons:Sandbox']
text = page.edit()
print 'Text in sandbox:', text.encode('utf-8')
page.save(text + u'\nExtra data', summary = 'Test edit')

# Printing imageusage
image = site.Images['Example.jpg']
print 'Image', image.name.encode('utf-8'), 'usage:'
for page in image.imageusage():
	print 'Used:', page.name.encode('utf-8'), '; namespace', page.namespace
	print 'Image info:', image.imageinfo

# Uploading a file
site.upload(open('file.jpg'), 'destination.jpg', 'Image description')

# Listing all categories (don't do this in reality)
for category in site.allcategories():
	print category
```
